#Next JS 
##What is next JS
It is framework for react libs

##Why?
- Server side rendering - helps in google search, renders required things at the time of page loading
- File based routing 
- Allows full stack development

## Create a project with typescript
npx create-next-app --ts

### Folder structure
- Unlike react app nextJs doesn't have index.html file in public folder, Index page will be generated dynamically at server.
